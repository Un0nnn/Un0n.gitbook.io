# XSS

XSS is writing JavaScript code inside client-side user inputs if the web app is not properly sanitized. Once a user views the same page, they execute the malicious JS code (Only affects client-side & limited to browser JS engines.).

> Even advanced payloads may not work with basic web pages as XSS paylods are designed to work with certain types of injections.

Keep in mind XSS is not exclusive to only HTML input fields but also in HTTP headers (Cookie, User-Agent) if their values are displayed on the page.

> Manual injection is not efficient so making our own python scripts tailored to the specific web page to automate the process will help.

The most efficient way of detecteing XSS is manual code review by understanding how the input is handled, and then crafting our payload.
