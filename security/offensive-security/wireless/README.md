* **WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy):** The first WiFi security protocol. It uses basic encryption but has major flaws that make it easily compromised. It’s now obsolete and should not be used.
* **WPA (WiFi Protected Access):** Introduced as a temporary fix for WEP, WPA improved encryption using **TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol)**. While stronger than WEP, it still has vulnerabilities and is considered outdated.
* **WPA2 (WiFi Protected Access II):** A major upgrade using **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** for strong and reliable encryption. It became the long-standing industry standard, offering robust protection for most networks.
* **WPA3 (WiFi Protected Access III):** The latest and most secure standard. It introduces **individualized data encryption**, stronger password-based authentication, and better defense against brute-force attacks.

[**Direct link to heading**](./#methodology) **Methodology**

1. **Passphrase Assessment:** Evaluate the strength and complexity of network passwords. Techniques like **dictionary**, **brute-force**, and **hybrid attacks** are used to test resistance against password cracking.
2. **Configuration Review:** Examine router and access point settings for weak configurations or misconfigurations. This includes reviewing **encryption protocols**, **authentication methods**, **SSID settings**, and **network segmentation** to ensure alignment with security best practices.
3. **Infrastructure Testing:** Assess the overall resilience of the WiFi infrastructure. This involves analyzing **network architecture**, **device configurations**, **firmware versions**, and identifying **implementation flaws** that attackers could exploit.
4. **Client Device Testing:** Inspect connected devices—such as **laptops, smartphones, and IoT systems**—for vulnerabilities in their **wireless drivers**, **OS**, or **network stack** that could be leveraged for unauthorized access.
